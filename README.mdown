Turbo Boost Disabler for Mac OS X
=================================

This kernel extension `DisableTurboBoost.kext` lets you disable [Intel Turbo Boost Technology](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html) present on latest Intel Core processors running *Mac OS X*.

This particular fork makes sure that the disabled TurboBoost state remains after the device returns from standby mode.

Abstract
--------

*Turbo Boost* technology provides automatic CPU over-clocking in certain situations where there is no risk of overheating the CPU. Unfortunately it has nasty effect of ruining various OpenCL and [OpenMP benchmark scores](http://openmp.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1289&p=5166&hilit=turbo+boost#p5166).

As observed *Turbo Boost* triggers when process is occupying 100% of single CPU core, while other CPU cores are idle. However when all CPU cores are occupied, *Turbo Boost* doesn't trigger as it would cause CPU overheat. As a result parallel tasks performance running on all CPU cores does not scale relatively to number of cores, i.e. for 4 core i5 CPU *OpenMP* program running on all 4 cores is only ~3x faster than 1 single core version.

Disabling *Turbo Boost* makes CPU run same clock regardless of cores occupation, therefore we get desired close to 4x speedup when running 4 cores OpenMP program vs 1 core.

This program implements modification of `MSR` CPU register responsible for *Turbo Boost* control as described in [Table 34-10. MSRs Supported by Intel Processors Based on Intel Microarchitecture Code Name Sandy Bridge (Contd.) - Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual Volume 3C](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html)
